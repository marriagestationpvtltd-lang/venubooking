## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Text still looks small

**Solution:** 
1. Check your browser's print scale setting
2. It should be at **100%** (not "Fit to page")

### Issue: More than 1 page appears

**Possible causes:**
1. Browser zoom is not at 100%
2. Print scale is not at 100%
3. Booking has excessive content (20+ items)

**Solutions:**
1. Reset browser zoom to 100%
2. Set print scale to 100%
3. This should be rare - contact support if it happens

### Issue: Backgrounds don't show

**Solution:**
1. In print dialog, enable "Print backgrounds"
2. Or: Don't worry - invoice is designed to look good without backgrounds too!
